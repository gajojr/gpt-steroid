## Guide for using AutoGPT

1. Click on the "Create New Chat" button.
2. Choose the `AutoGPT` option to create a chat with AutoGPT.
3. Start the conversation by asking a question or providing input through the chat interface.
4. If you are continuing an existing chat session, you can use the prompt `where were we` as the first question to get an overview of the previous conversation.
5. Interact with AutoGPT by providing input or commands based on the context of the conversation.
6. To authorize a specific command or action, you can provide the input `y` when prompted.
7. Keep in mind the following considerations while using AutoGPT:
   - AutoGPT mode does not support fine-tuning.
   - Docker is used to run AutoGPT in an isolated environment to ensure security and prevent potential harm from external content.
